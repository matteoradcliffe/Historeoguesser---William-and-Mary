# Historeoguesser! - William and Mary Historical GeoGuesser

Hey there! Just some important notes here:

-  Go to this link to play the game: https://mmmmmspicy.github.io (you may need to reload the page once).

-  If you want to download these files and run it yourself, you must run it on a live server! To connect with the Google Maps API, the files need internet access, so a live server is required. The easiest way to do this is by using the Live Server extension in VSCode.

- To run the file locally, open index.html on the live server. Everything else should take care of itself!

- That's it for now! Enjoy the game! :)
